This is the first post, of my blog and I am starting this to motivate myself to keep learning and understanding diffrenet programming lanaguages.

I am very passionate to learn various langauages such as :
- PHP
- C/C++
- Python

These are a couple of areas I want to explore in the coming months/years and I wanted to kind of share my journey.

But until then, I'll leave you all with
{% highlight c %}
void HelloWorld(){
  printf("Hello World! \n");
}
{% endhighlight %}


Goodbye.
